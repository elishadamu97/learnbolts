What is a quadratic equation?

A <b>quadratic equation</b> is a second degree equation, that comprises of:
1. Variables
2. Constants

These variables are unknown values that can be gotten using different methods such as:
1. [Factorization method](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/factorization-of-quadratic-equations/#:~:text=Steps%20to%20factorize%20quadratic%20equation,%2B%20c%2Fa%20%3D%200.).
2. [Completing the square method](../completing-the-square)
3. [Graphical method](https://www.nagwa.com/en/explainers/612170817959/)
4. [Quadratic formula method](../quadratic-formula/).

A constant is a natural number or a whole number that never changes in expression, it remains the same regardless.

The standard form for quadratic equations is

$$ax^2 + bx +c = 0$$

- Where $ a, b, c$ are known values and $a \neq 0$.
- $x = $   unknown value 

If  $a =  0$ the equation is a linear equation and not quadratic

<b>Prove:</b>

Using the standard equation.

$ax^2 + bx +c = 0$ ------  $equation \,(1)$ 

If    $a =  0$ 

Substitute   $a =  0$ into $equation \,(1)$

$(0)x^2 + bx +c = 0$

0 will multiply $x^2 $

The equation will be

$ bx +c = 0$ ------- $equation (2)$

A standard linear equation is <b>$Ax+By = C$</b>

By comparing $equation (2)$ with the standard linear equation

This proves why $a =  0$ cannot be a quadratic equation.

Examples of quadratic equations are:

- $6x^2\,+ 11x-35 = 0 $
- $x^2\, - 5x-14 = 0 $
- $2x^2\, -7x-15 = 0 $
