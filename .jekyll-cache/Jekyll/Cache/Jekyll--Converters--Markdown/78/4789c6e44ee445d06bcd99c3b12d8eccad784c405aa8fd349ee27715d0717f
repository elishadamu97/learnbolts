<p> <br /> Hi Friends,<br /> <br /> In this project, I am gonna share you the story how I managed to build a simple and cheap mini-drone my own. Everything started when I decided to shop a mini RC drone and one of my friends told me to build one instead of buying one. I can explain you the entire build process in fewer steps.</p>
